#  Ideas to develop

- makes all three Build methods in Coordinator open the same description view to demonstrate the pattern in a more generic way
- improve coordinator to automatically know what is the latest screen to dismiss and thus,
    not rely on ViewNavFooter to get the information
    - Make List generic view to set the presentation mode in data
- make it so descriptionView be able to popTo Root from sheet and fsView 
- leading text in descriptionView
- rename elementData DetailData
- make previews data for Views "LOCAL"
