#  Ideas to develop

- make Lion, carrot and boba view only one "description view"
- makes all three Build methods in Coordinator open the same description view to demonstrate the pattern in a more generic way
- improve coordinator to automatically know what is the latest screen to dismiss and thus,
    not rely on ViewNavFooter to get the information
