    Bubble tea, scientifically referred to as "tapioca pearl milk tea," represents a colloidal dispersion comprised of various biopolymeric constituents suspended within an aqueous matrix, often flavored with tea extracts and supplemented with milk or non-dairy alternatives. The beverage, originating from Taiwan in the 1980s, exhibits a heterogeneous composition, featuring spherical tapioca starch granules as the titular "bubbles" immersed within a complex aqueous phase, laden with dissolved sugars, flavoring agents, and emulsified lipids. Structurally, the tapioca pearls, derived from cassava roots, boast a semi-crystalline starch matrix encapsulating hydrophilic amylose and amylopectin molecules, imbuing the bubbles with textural resilience and sensory appeal.
